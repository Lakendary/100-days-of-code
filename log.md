# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1

### Day 10: October 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about rendering sections in layouts for all views or how to specify a section for only some views to use. Learned about the ViewStart razor page view. This file indicates which layout to use depending on where this file is placed, which is typically in the Views folder. ViewStart files help reduce code redundancy and improves maintainability.

**Thoughts:** Sections and ViewStarts help to customize how each web page should be laid out. Its easy to repeat elements that need to be on every web page and its also to set each page or a group of pagese to be different.

### Day 9: October 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I didn't follow the tutorial but did some maintenance on a tool I for work instead. I didn't learn anything new during this exercise. I did listen to a YouTube video on my way to work about 5 programming bad habits to avoid. 

**Thoughts:** Usually there is something new to learn, even when debugging or maintaining an application but I didn't make much progress. I couldn't test what I needed to test.

### Day 8: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about a view model which is created when the model doesn't have all the information a view needs. I learned how to use an enumerable and passing a list of objects to a view and display it. I learned about layout views to save time in writing the html boilerplate for each webpage. 

**Thoughts:** In the past I would update my model so that when I passed the data to the UI, it would have all the information required. I like the ViewModel approach. It makes sure that all the information is there without messing with your model.

### Day 7: October 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about setting a custom view instead of running the view with the same name as the controller method. I also learned the difference between absolute paths and relative paths and that you don't need to specify the extension on the relative path.

I learned how to pass data to a view with ViewData and ViewBag and also why its bad to do it this way as they are loosely typed views. Using strongly typed view by specifying the model type in the view using @model directive.

**Thoughts:** Its great to have options in development but in the beginning I prefer to learn the industry standard and then maybe learn the others when I need them. However, its good that I know of all three ways on how to pass data to a view.

### Day 6: October 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create a new model and its repository interface. Also created a mock class to create mock data for the model and why its done this way. It helps with dependency injection, which has the benefit loose coupling and easy to unit test.

I learned about controllers and how to return JsonResults. Created a view in the right folder structure. 

**Thoughts:** My knowledge on interfaces are sketchy so I'm hoping that it would become clearer later how to use these repository interfaces.

### Day 5: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about environment variables like development, staging, production and custom environments and how to set these environments. I learned about the basics of the MVC design pattern. I can also setup Visual Studio to use MVC in the request pipeline.

**Thoughts:** I like that you can set the environment variable on your operating system. So you can have a PC dedicated for developing and another for staging/production. MVC was new to me but how to add it the configuration services was new. I can't wait to get started with the coding part though. This is starting to drag, but I know this is essential later on when I need to debug.

### Day 4: October 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the request pipeline and how to log messages which can be viewed in output. I also learned how to add static files and the importance of the order of the middleware for serving static files and the default html file. Finally I learned about the developer exception page and how it displays exceptions.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I will use this in my web projects yet but its good to know if I ever need to debug exceptions and the middleware. I hope this all becomes clearer later on when I get my hands dirty with MVC.

### Day 3: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about launch settings under properties and appsettings file. I had to create the appsettings file manually but it still managed to work as expected. Finally, I learned about middleware.

**Thoughts:** Its tough when you are following a tutorial and things aren't exactly the same. Its a trial and error process. In the end you hope that the differences you see don't have a major impact later down the line.

### Day 2: October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do much coding. Just learned about In Process and Out of Process hosting. 

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the SDK 2.2 to work. As soon as I ran my project, I got an error. I started a project with 2.1 anyway now I can't get In Process hosting to work, in particular IIS Express. I am not sure with it has anything to do with the fact that I am using SDK 2.1. I will stick to it because its a LTS version, whereas SDK 2.2 is no longer supported.

### Day 1: October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Setup ASP.NET environment. Temporarily used ASP.NET SDK 2.1 until I download SDK 2.2 to follow along with the tutorial. No git file to upload just yet.

**Thoughts:** I've learned how to remove origin from a git repo and add a new one. I've learned the differences between the different types of web applications you can create in Visual Studio. Also learned the elements of the ASP.NET Core project file.
