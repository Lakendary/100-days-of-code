# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: September 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I couldn't do some coding in the morning because I had to go to work early and its Friday but I managed to get some coding done. Even on a Friday night. I started on a ASP.NET Core tutorial to try to understand how to build a basic CRUD app before I start with the Price Book Club. 

**Thoughts:** Try to get the coding done early in the morning because it feels like a burden later the evening.

### Day 5: September 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did some planning for the Price Book Club Web application. I created an ER Diagram with Visual Paradigm.

**Thoughts:** There is more to associate tables and the relationship between the entities. I keep thinking I've missed something but it looks good so far.

### Day 4: September 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do much today. I finished updating my portfolio website. I probably just have to upload my updated CV to finish it off. I'm getting ready for ASP.NET Core, so I spent all my time setting up my environment (my internet connection is very slow) and reading the ASP.NET Core docs.

**Thoughts:** Didn't learn much. Just how to start a ASP.NET Core web server.

### Day 3: September 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: The Font Awesome 5 icons was not working on the other web pages on my website and I already merged to the master branch. Also, there is one web page that loads ways too long. I had to compress and resize the GIFs on that page. The home link was scrolling to the top of the page instead of going back to the main web page (index). 

**Thoughts:** Make sure the links work when you copy and paste them from another document. Resizing reduces the size more than plain old optimization. Check the classes in an element, it doesn't necessarily link to CSS, it could link to JavaScript too.

### Day 2: September 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Managed to add the new Font Awesome 5 font to my website. It works for the social icons and the services icons. However, the icons inside the buttons don't work. 

**Thoughts:** Cannot stress how important it is to first read the documentation.

### Day 1: September 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add a link to my blog on my portfolio site by adding a Font Awesome icon to the home page. However, I had to upgrade my Font Awesome and it broke the Font Awesome icons. Also added the Google Analytics tag to track users on my portfolio site, but that doesn't work either.

**Thoughts:** Read the documentation first. I think I may have found a solution. I've thought about starting my portfolio website from scratch because it was a template I purchased, but I'm determined to fix it so that I can learn how to work with other developer's code.
