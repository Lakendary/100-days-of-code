# 100 Days Of Code Log

## Round 1

### Day 18: November 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the differences between a singleton, scoped and transient service type. I learned about Entity Framework Core and how to install the package to use for a selected project depending on which database type you want to use. I learned about DbContext class and how to implement with DbContext options.

**Thoughts:** The service types are still a bit iffy to me. I am not sure how I will use it and which service type is best. For now I will stick to singleton and hope for the best. The DbContext class is also a concept that I don't fully grasp as yet. I hope its one of those things you can set and forget and it should just work all the time.

### Day 17: November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to serialize and de-serialize the info in an XML file. I learned how to reference a project static file in your code. I learned how to include the XML file in my project and copy the content (only when newer) to the debug file. I learned how to reference this file in my code.

**Thoughts:** I cheated a little today, but its okay because development isn't part of my job title. I didn't get up to code this morning but I did some coding for work.

### Day 16: November 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about model binding. I used this to bind the name properties of a form to the properties of the object/class I was submitting the form to. I learned form validation attributes. I also learned how to validate a select list enums. The required validation is built in and you have to use a question mark (?) to make it return a nullable in order to make it optional. I have to combine this with the required validation anyway in order to return the correct validation message.

**Thoughts:** Its important that the name of each input field in a create form matches the property name of the class. ASP.NET makes it easy to use data validation because most of the functionality is already built in. You just specify it in your model and display the error messages in your view. The enum required validation is a bit quirky. I'll have to remember how it works in the future because I won't get the error message I want to see.

### Day 15: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to insert a bootstrap navigation menu. I also learned how to insert a collapsible menu for smaller screens. I also learned how to add a form to view.

**Thoughts:** Lots of typing today and not too much learned. I definitely need to take a course in bootstrap after I'm done with this tutorial to brush up on my front-end skills.

### Day 14: November 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned why we use tag helpers to generate links. Basically, if you update your route, you are safe if you used tag helpers. I learned about image tag helpers which helps with caching images and only downloads new images if its changed on the web server, otherwise it uses the image in the cache.

I learned about environment tag helpers which helps to load different files when in different environments, for example loading the full bootstrap stylesheet when in development but loading the minified version when in staging or production.

**Thoughts:** Even though its a lot more work in the beginning to setup tag helpers, it will save you a lot more time in the future when you have to maintain the code and if the routing changes.

### Day 13: November 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about Library Manager, a client side library acquisition tool. I add bootstrap and jquery using this tool. I learned how to update and delete libraries added with LibMan.

I learned how to add bootstrap and reference it to start using it in my projects. I also learned how to use tag helpers to generate links.

**Thoughts:** Tag helpers seem like a lot of work but I suspect that the benefit is that maintenance of your code would be easier with these. I'll find out tomorrow what the benefits are. I liked using LibMan. Its simpler than using Nuget Package Manager or NPM for example.

### Day 12: November 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about ViewImports and how it helps with using common namespaces so that you don't have to keep repeating it in the views. I also learned about conventional routing and how to setup your own routes and not just the default MVC routes. And I learned about attribute routing, which is a bit more flexible than conventional routing.

**Thoughts:** Its definitely more difficult to code at night. I'm very tired and I was staring at the clock a lot. Try to get the coding done early. But tomorrow morning is another tough day. Hopefully I don't skip another day.

### Day 11: October 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I was up late last night watching the United vs Chelsea game and couldn't bring myself to get out of bed at 5 AM this morning. I tried to get some sort of coding done but didn't really get a gap during the day.

**Thoughts:** If it doesn't happen early the morning, it probably won't happen the rest of the day.

### Day 10: October 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about rendering sections in layouts for all views or how to specify a section for only some views to use. Learned about the ViewStart razor page view. This file indicates which layout to use depending on where this file is placed, which is typically in the Views folder. ViewStart files help reduce code redundancy and improves maintainability.

**Thoughts:** Sections and ViewStarts help to customize how each web page should be laid out. Its easy to repeat elements that need to be on every web page and its also to set each page or a group of pages to be different.

### Day 9: October 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I didn't follow the tutorial but did some maintenance on a tool I for work instead. I didn't learn anything new during this exercise. I did listen to a YouTube video on my way to work about 5 programming bad habits to avoid.

**Thoughts:** Usually there is something new to learn, even when debugging or maintaining an application but I didn't make much progress. I couldn't test what I needed to test.

### Day 8: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about a view model which is created when the model doesn't have all the information a view needs. I learned how to use an enumerable and passing a list of objects to a view and display it. I learned about layout views to save time in writing the html boilerplate for each webpage.

**Thoughts:** In the past I would update my model so that when I passed the data to the UI, it would have all the information required. I like the ViewModel approach. It makes sure that all the information is there without messing with your model.

### Day 7: October 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about setting a custom view instead of running the view with the same name as the controller method. I also learned the difference between absolute paths and relative paths and that you don't need to specify the extension on the relative path.

I learned how to pass data to a view with ViewData and ViewBag and also why its bad to do it this way as they are loosely typed views. Using strongly typed view by specifying the model type in the view using @model directive.

**Thoughts:** Its great to have options in development but in the beginning I prefer to learn the industry standard and then maybe learn the others when I need them. However, its good that I know of all three ways on how to pass data to a view.

### Day 6: October 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create a new model and its repository interface. Also created a mock class to create mock data for the model and why its done this way. It helps with dependency injection, which has the benefit loose coupling and easy to unit test.

I learned about controllers and how to return JsonResults. Created a view in the right folder structure.

**Thoughts:** My knowledge on interfaces are sketchy so I'm hoping that it would become clearer later how to use these repository interfaces.

### Day 5: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about environment variables like development, staging, production and custom environments and how to set these environments. I learned about the basics of the MVC design pattern. I can also setup Visual Studio to use MVC in the request pipeline.

**Thoughts:** I like that you can set the environment variable on your operating system. So you can have a PC dedicated for developing and another for staging/production. MVC was new to me but how to add it the configuration services was new. I can't wait to get started with the coding part though. This is starting to drag, but I know this is essential later on when I need to debug.

### Day 4: October 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the request pipeline and how to log messages which can be viewed in output. I also learned how to add static files and the importance of the order of the middleware for serving static files and the default html file. Finally I learned about the developer exception page and how it displays exceptions.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I will use this in my web projects yet but its good to know if I ever need to debug exceptions and the middleware. I hope this all becomes clearer later on when I get my hands dirty with MVC.

### Day 3: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about launch settings under properties and appsettings file. I had to create the appsettings file manually but it still managed to work as expected. Finally, I learned about middleware.

**Thoughts:** Its tough when you are following a tutorial and things aren't exactly the same. Its a trial and error process. In the end you hope that the differences you see don't have a major impact later down the line.

### Day 2: October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do much coding. Just learned about In Process and Out of Process hosting.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the SDK 2.2 to work. As soon as I ran my project, I got an error. I started a project with 2.1 anyway now I can't get In Process hosting to work, in particular IIS Express. I am not sure with it has anything to do with the fact that I am using SDK 2.1. I will stick to it because its a LTS version, whereas SDK 2.2 is no longer supported.

### Day 1: October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Setup ASP.NET environment. Temporarily used ASP.NET SDK 2.1 until I download SDK 2.2 to follow along with the tutorial. No git file to upload just yet.

**Thoughts:** I've learned how to remove origin from a git repo and add a new one. I've learned the differences between the different types of web applications you can create in Visual Studio. Also learned the elements of the ASP.NET Core project file.
