# 100 Days Of Code Log

## Round 1

### Day 46: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about password complexity and how to set my own rules for a password. I also learned how to logout a user.

**Thoughts:** Again, a lot of these features are built-in and pretty standard. And the fact that it's customizable makes it even easier. However, it does look complex if you don't know where to start.

### Day 45: December 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the identity user manager and the sign in manager and used to those two configuration services to register a new user.

**Thoughts:** It helps to have authentication built in and make life a whole lot easier. Authentication was a pain in the back side when I learned about it in NodeJS.

### Day 44: December 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** No progress. I didn't code on my birthday.

**Thoughts:** To be totally honest, I used my birthday as an excuse to sleep late.

### Day 43: December 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I added an account controller and a register account view. I also updated the navigation bar.

**Thoughts:** Nothing new learned in today, mostly just old stuff that I've learned before.

### Day 41 to 42: November 30 to December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** No coding done on my birthday weekend.

**Thoughts:** I needed a break from coding and I had a lot to do. Also Sunday morning I was a bit hungover. 

### Day 40: November 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about identity. I created the identity data tables built in ASP.NET Core.

**Thoughts:** I don't remember much about this lesson because I was interrupted a lot.

### Day 39: November 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I installed the NLog Nuget package and learned how to configure NLog to save logging messages to a text file. I learned about the different log levels and how to filter those logs by category and by logging provider.

**Thoughts:** Its cool to log all what happens on your application. I'm just not too sure how or when I will make use of log categories.

### Day 38: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the keyframes rules on freecodecamp.org, transitioning from one color to the next and moving it with the left and top offset CSS properties. I learned about animation-name, animation-duration and animation-iteration-count. 

**Thoughts:** This looks very cool when I'm told what to do, but I doubt I am creative enough to come up with my own animations. This is some serious stuff.

### Day 37: November 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about logging in debug mode and logging to console. I learned that logging is built into the create web host method. I learned how to log errors to the console using the logger interface from the Microsoft namespace. 

**Thoughts:** I had a couple of issues with this one but I still managed to output some errors to the console window.

### Day 36: November 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about global exception handling. I learned how to setup the middleware to the request processing pipeline, implement the error controller and create the view for the errors.

**Thoughts:** Recently I've learned how important it is to log errors and review them on a regular basis. It's great that I learn how to log these errors properly.

### Day 34 to 35: November 23 to 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** No progess at all. My baby boy is going to be baptised on Sunday. 

**Thoughts:** Coding needs to take a break sometimes. I find it hard to get time on the weekends to code. I feel like this is the best time to get some coding done but at the same time I also think that I need to unwind on the weekends to prevent burnout.

### Day 33: November 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about status code pages and how to set them up. I learned how to create my own error handling page to handle 404 errors.

**Thoughts:** I only know of the 404 exception status, I wonder how many there are and how many are common enough that you need to handle them.

### Day 32: November 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I continued my freecodecamp.org course. I learned about the transform property in CSS, namely scaling, rotating and skewing elements. 

**Thoughts:** CSS is a lot more complicated than I anticipated.

### Day 31: November 20, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to show a custom error page when a user navigates to a resource with a specified ID that does not exist.

**Thoughts:** Slow start but I am at least moving and not standing still.

### Day 30: November 19, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create the edit method to post updates. I also learned how to delete an existing file that's no longer used and why its important to close/dispose the file stream method.

**Thoughts:** Slow start but I am at least moving and not standing still.

**Link to work:** [Employee Management](https://github.com/Lakendary/EmployeeManagement)

### Day 29: November 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned that my application has more bugs that I need to fix. I learned that scheduling time to test your new features is critical and fixing old bugs first before implementing new features is even more critical.

**Thoughts:** Time management is key. And communicating is key too. You cannot anticipate how long you'll actually be spending on fixing errors.

### Day 27 to 28: November 16 to 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do any coding over the weekend.

**Thoughts:** Because I've spent so much time coding during the week, I decided that I'm going to spend some time with my family to help with stress that coding during the week has caused.

### Day 26: November 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I made notes on what I've learned in ASP.NET Core so far.

**Thoughts:** It helps to have some notes at hand for future reference. And looking at the code again helps to solidify what I've learned up to now.

**Link to work:** [ASP.NET Notes](https://github.com/Lakendary/100-days-of-code/blob/master/ASP.Net%20Notes.md)

### Day 25: November 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I added some features to the JRS Document Storage application. 

**Thoughts:** Adding new features to an existing project is the nice and easy bit. What comes next is testing and fixing bugs, which is not fun at all.

**Link to work:** [JRS Document Storage](https://www.jaderickerts.com/projects/jrs-document-storage.html)

### Day 24: November 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create an edit view model and an edit view and how to populate existing model data to the view's form.

**Thoughts:** I'm progressing very slowly lately. But I am learning a lot at once.

### Day 23: November 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to upload multiple file. I did some coding at work and learned how to setup my database connection string without a password especially with XAMPP.

**Thoughts:** I did some more coding at work, which should make up for yesterday's tardiness.

**Link to work:** [Employee Management](https://github.com/Lakendary/EmployeeManagement)

### Day 22: November 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I slept in thinking I will work on some code at work but then something else came up instead. No coding done.

**Thoughts:** Some days just don't work out like they are supposed to.

### Day 21: November 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to keep the domain models and the database schema in sync with migrations. I learned how to undo migration before the database was updated and also how to undo changes after the database was updated. I learned how to upload an image using a form and how to display that file.

**Thoughts:** There is a migration history table in the database that EF Core creates to help with undoing changes to the database. My file isn't uploading because I used a PNG. It only works with JPG. My CSS isn't working out.

### Day 20: November 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about migration and how to update a database with a migration file. I learned how to seed the database with data by using the model builder. I also learned how to clean up the database context class by using an extensions class for model builder.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately my update-database command didn't work. I encountered this bug before. I had to manually create the database and then only update the database with the migration file.

I like the extensions class. Pretty nifty trick to keep your classes from getting too cluttered.

### Day 19: November 8, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to add the application context to the configuration services and how to link the database connection string from the application settings to the configuration services. I learned about the benefits of using the repository design pattern. It makes your code easier to maintain, reuse, easy to test and its loosely coupled. I learned how to add another class to the initial repository interface.

**Thoughts:** The repository pattern is pretty cool. I like how you can just play and play any data source and only change one line of code to use the newly created data source.

### Day 18: November 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the differences between a singleton, scoped and transient service type. I learned about Entity Framework Core and how to install the package to use for a selected project depending on which database type you want to use. I learned about DbContext class and how to implement with DbContext options.

**Thoughts:** The service types are still a bit iffy to me. I am not sure how I will use it and which service type is best. For now I will stick to singleton and hope for the best. The DbContext class is also a concept that I don't fully grasp as yet. I hope its one of those things you can set and forget and it should just work all the time.

### Day 17: November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to serialize and de-serialize the info in an XML file. I learned how to reference a project static file in your code. I learned how to include the XML file in my project and copy the content (only when newer) to the debug file. I learned how to reference this file in my code.

**Thoughts:** I cheated a little today, but its okay because development isn't part of my job title. I didn't get up to code this morning but I did some coding for work.

### Day 16: November 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about model binding. I used this to bind the name properties of a form to the properties of the object/class I was submitting the form to. I learned form validation attributes. I also learned how to validate a select list enums. The required validation is built in and you have to use a question mark (?) to make it return a nullable in order to make it optional. I have to combine this with the required validation anyway in order to return the correct validation message.

**Thoughts:** Its important that the name of each input field in a create form matches the property name of the class. ASP.NET makes it easy to use data validation because most of the functionality is already built in. You just specify it in your model and display the error messages in your view. The enum required validation is a bit quirky. I'll have to remember how it works in the future because I won't get the error message I want to see.

### Day 15: November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to insert a bootstrap navigation menu. I also learned how to insert a collapsible menu for smaller screens. I also learned how to add a form to view.

**Thoughts:** Lots of typing today and not too much learned. I definitely need to take a course in bootstrap after I'm done with this tutorial to brush up on my front-end skills.

### Day 14: November 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned why we use tag helpers to generate links. Basically, if you update your route, you are safe if you used tag helpers. I learned about image tag helpers which helps with caching images and only downloads new images if its changed on the web server, otherwise it uses the image in the cache.

I learned about environment tag helpers which helps to load different files when in different environments, for example loading the full bootstrap stylesheet when in development but loading the minified version when in staging or production.

**Thoughts:** Even though its a lot more work in the beginning to setup tag helpers, it will save you a lot more time in the future when you have to maintain the code and if the routing changes.

### Day 13: November 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about Library Manager, a client side library acquisition tool. I add bootstrap and jquery using this tool. I learned how to update and delete libraries added with LibMan.

I learned how to add bootstrap and reference it to start using it in my projects. I also learned how to use tag helpers to generate links.

**Thoughts:** Tag helpers seem like a lot of work but I suspect that the benefit is that maintenance of your code would be easier with these. I'll find out tomorrow what the benefits are. I liked using LibMan. Its simpler than using Nuget Package Manager or NPM for example.

### Day 12: November 1, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about ViewImports and how it helps with using common namespaces so that you don't have to keep repeating it in the views. I also learned about conventional routing and how to setup your own routes and not just the default MVC routes. And I learned about attribute routing, which is a bit more flexible than conventional routing.

**Thoughts:** Its definitely more difficult to code at night. I'm very tired and I was staring at the clock a lot. Try to get the coding done early. But tomorrow morning is another tough day. Hopefully I don't skip another day.

### Day 11: October 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I was up late last night watching the United vs Chelsea game and couldn't bring myself to get out of bed at 5 AM this morning. I tried to get some sort of coding done but didn't really get a gap during the day.

**Thoughts:** If it doesn't happen early the morning, it probably won't happen the rest of the day.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 11 - #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/lkn_ant/status/1189783368663257093?s=20)

### Day 10: October 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about rendering sections in layouts for all views or how to specify a section for only some views to use. Learned about the ViewStart razor page view. This file indicates which layout to use depending on where this file is placed, which is typically in the Views folder. ViewStart files help reduce code redundancy and improves maintainability.

**Thoughts:** Sections and ViewStarts help to customize how each web page should be laid out. Its easy to repeat elements that need to be on every web page and its also to set each page or a group of pages to be different.

### Day 9: October 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Today I didn't follow the tutorial but did some maintenance on a tool I for work instead. I didn't learn anything new during this exercise. I did listen to a YouTube video on my way to work about 5 programming bad habits to avoid.

**Thoughts:** Usually there is something new to learn, even when debugging or maintaining an application but I didn't make much progress. I couldn't test what I needed to test.

**Link to tweet:** [Day 9 - #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/lkn_ant/status/1189025581414998016?s=20)

### Day 8: October 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about a view model which is created when the model doesn't have all the information a view needs. I learned how to use an enumerable and passing a list of objects to a view and display it. I learned about layout views to save time in writing the html boilerplate for each webpage.

**Thoughts:** In the past I would update my model so that when I passed the data to the UI, it would have all the information required. I like the ViewModel approach. It makes sure that all the information is there without messing with your model.

### Day 7: October 27, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about setting a custom view instead of running the view with the same name as the controller method. I also learned the difference between absolute paths and relative paths and that you don't need to specify the extension on the relative path.

I learned how to pass data to a view with ViewData and ViewBag and also why its bad to do it this way as they are loosely typed views. Using strongly typed view by specifying the model type in the view using @model directive.

**Thoughts:** Its great to have options in development but in the beginning I prefer to learn the industry standard and then maybe learn the others when I need them. However, its good that I know of all three ways on how to pass data to a view.

### Day 6: October 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned how to create a new model and its repository interface. Also created a mock class to create mock data for the model and why its done this way. It helps with dependency injection, which has the benefit loose coupling and easy to unit test.

I learned about controllers and how to return JsonResults. Created a view in the right folder structure.

**Thoughts:** My knowledge on interfaces are sketchy so I'm hoping that it would become clearer later how to use these repository interfaces.

### Day 5: October 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about environment variables like development, staging, production and custom environments and how to set these environments. I learned about the basics of the MVC design pattern. I can also setup Visual Studio to use MVC in the request pipeline.

**Thoughts:** I like that you can set the environment variable on your operating system. So you can have a PC dedicated for developing and another for staging/production. MVC was new to me but how to add it the configuration services was new. I can't wait to get started with the coding part though. This is starting to drag, but I know this is essential later on when I need to debug.

### Day 4: October 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about the request pipeline and how to log messages which can be viewed in output. I also learned how to add static files and the importance of the order of the middleware for serving static files and the default html file. Finally I learned about the developer exception page and how it displays exceptions.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I will use this in my web projects yet but its good to know if I ever need to debug exceptions and the middleware. I hope this all becomes clearer later on when I get my hands dirty with MVC.

### Day 3: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I learned about launch settings under properties and appsettings file. I had to create the appsettings file manually but it still managed to work as expected. Finally, I learned about middleware.

**Thoughts:** Its tough when you are following a tutorial and things aren't exactly the same. Its a trial and error process. In the end you hope that the differences you see don't have a major impact later down the line.

### Day 2: October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I didn't do much coding. Just learned about In Process and Out of Process hosting.

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the SDK 2.2 to work. As soon as I ran my project, I got an error. I started a project with 2.1 anyway now I can't get In Process hosting to work, in particular IIS Express. I am not sure with it has anything to do with the fact that I am using SDK 2.1. I will stick to it because its a LTS version, whereas SDK 2.2 is no longer supported.

### Day 1: October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Setup ASP.NET environment. Temporarily used ASP.NET SDK 2.1 until I download SDK 2.2 to follow along with the tutorial. No git file to upload just yet.

**Thoughts:** I've learned how to remove origin from a git repo and add a new one. I've learned the differences between the different types of web applications you can create in Visual Studio. Also learned the elements of the ASP.NET Core project file.
