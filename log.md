# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1

### Day 3: October 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I learned about launch settings under properties and appsettings file. I had to create the appsettings file manually but it still managed to work as expected. Finally, I learned about middleware.

**Thoughts:** Its tough when you are following a tutorial and things aren't exactly the same. Its a trial and error process. In the end you hope that the differences you see don't have a major impact later down the line.

### Day 2: October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do much coding. Just learned about In Process and Out of Process hosting. 

**Thoughts:** I couldn't get the SDK 2.2 to work. As soon as I ran my project, I got an error. I started a project with 2.1 anyway now I can't get In Process hosting to work, in particular IIS Express. I am not sure with it has anything to do with the fact that I am using SDK 2.1. I will stick to it because its a LTS version, whereas SDK 2.2 is no longer supported.

### Day 1: October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setup ASP.NET environment. Temporarily used ASP.NET SDK 2.1 until I download SDK 2.2 to follow along with the tutorial. No git file to upload just yet.

**Thoughts:** I've learned how to remove origin from a git repo and add a new one. I've learned the differences between the different types of web applications you can create in Visual Studio. Also learned the elements of the ASP.NET Core project file.
