# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: September 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: The Font Awesome 5 icons was not working on the other web pages on my website and I already merged to the master branch. Also, there is one web page that loads ways too long. I had to compress and resize the GIFs on that page.

**Thoughts:** Make sure the links work when you copy and paste them from another document. Resizing reduces the size more than plain old optimization.

### Day 2: September 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Managed to add the new Font Awesome 5 font to my website. It works for the social icons and the services icons. However, the icons inside the buttons don't work. 

**Thoughts:** Cannot stress how important it is to first read the documentation.

### Day 1: September 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to add a link to my blog on my portfolio site by adding a Font Awesome icon to the home page. However, I had to upgrade my Font Awesome and it broke the Font Awesome icons. Also added the Google Analytics tag to track users on my portfolio site, but that doesn't work either.

**Thoughts:** Read the documentation first. I think I may have found a solution. I've thought about starting my portfolio website from scratch because it was a template I purchased, but I'm determined to fix it so that I can learn how to work with other developer's code.
