# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setup ASP.NET environment. Temporarily used ASP.NET SDK 2.1 until I download SDK 2.2 to follow along with the tutorial. No git file to upload just yet.

**Thoughts:** I've learned how to remove origin from a git repo and add a new one. I've learned the differences between the different types of web applications you can create in Visual Studio. Also learned the elements of the ASP.NET Core project file.
